# Data Structures And Algorithms

This Repository contains a list of DSA Problems.
These are the only DSA Problems I did for my placements.I would urge you all to practice this DSA questions as a revision that will really boost up your performance for your DSA rounds.

## List of All DSA Questions
### Arrays
- 1.Creation and Operations on Arrays
- 2.Linear Search
- 3.Binary Search
- 4.Largest and Smallest Element in Array
- 5.Reverse an Array without extra space
- 6.Pairs in Array
- 7.Subarrays in Array
- 8.Kadanes Algorithm
- 9.Trapped Rain Water
- 10.Best time to Buy and Sell Stocks
- 11.Find at least one Duplicate in Array
- 12.Find Element in Rotated Sorted Array
- 13.Find Triplets with specific conditions

### Matrix or 2D Arrays
- 1.Creation and Operation on Matrix
- 2.Spiral Matrix Traversal
- 3.Diagnol Sum:Find Sum of both Promary and Secondary Diagnol
- 4.Search in Sorted Matrix using Staircase Pattern
- 5.Count the numebr of times a number occured in Matrix
- 6.Sum of numbers of nth row in Matrix
- 7.Transpose of a Matrix

### Strings
- 1.Creation , Input , Output and In-Built String Functions
- 2.Check if the Given String is Palindrome or Not
- 3.Find Shortest Distance or Dispalcement from Point to Point
- 4.More In-Built String functions which can be used to solve larger problems
- 5.New Data Structure called String Builder simialr to strigns but better efficiency and all operatinos on strings can be done using stringBUilders
- 6.Convert First letter of Each word in a Sentence to UpperCase
- 7.String Compression usgin String as DataStructure and Also String Builder as a Data Structure
- 8.Count the Number of Lower case vowels Occured in string
- 9.Check if the 2 Strings are Anagrams or Not
